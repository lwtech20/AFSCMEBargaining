      <div class="title"> <h1>2022 Merced County Bargaining</h1></div>
      <div class="content-title"><h2>Bargaining Kickoff</h2></div>
      <div class="content"><p>On March 31, 2022 your bargaining team kicked off negotiations with the County. It is going to be a battle. We need to stand in solidarity like never before. We can and will get a fair contract but it is going to take effort and activity. We all have to do whatever we can to get a fair contract with no take aways.</p>
        <p>Your bargianing team will be working tirelessly to make sure that we all get a fair deal this time around but we need your input! Recently we sent out a survey for you to compelte by April 8, 2022. If you haven't yet, please take 5 minutes to complete the survey. If we don't know what is important to you, we don't know what proposals to push forward. </p>
        <p>We also need you to stand in solidarity with your bargaining team. As long as we know we have your support then we know we can and will win a good contract. It is often said, "Together we bargain, divided we beg". We need your help to bargain.</p>
      <p>At the top of this page there is a link called < href="volunteer.html">Get Active</a>. If you can we need you to get active. This can be anything from getting new members signed up (think strength in numbers), distribute union information at your worksite, give this link to members that don't have it, sit on bargaining committees, and the list goes on.</p>
      <p>We will be bargaining with the county on the following dates: <br>
        April 14, 2022<br>
        April 28, 2022<br>
        May 2022<br>
        May 2022<br>
        June 2022<br>
        June 2022</p>
        <p>This will be your place to get all the updates on bargaining as they come through. Just another reminder that if you have NOT completed the survery please <a href="https://us18.list-manage.com/survey?u=71e146dde867ecad0c0217530&id=39a8114ed1&attribution=false">click here</a> and complete the survey now!</p>
